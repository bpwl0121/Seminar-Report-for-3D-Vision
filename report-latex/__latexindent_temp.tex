\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	The paper "KinectFusion: Real-Time Dense Surface Mapping and Tracking" was published by Microsoft Research and was published in 2011. 
	The method proposed in this paper is a pioneering work based on a low-cost RGB-D camera for real-time reconstruction tracking and reconstruction algorithms suitable for different lighting conditions, creating an important framework for 3D dense reconstruction. This paper shows that this method can accurately obtain tracking and mapping results in real-time in room-sized scenes using only commodity sensors and GPU hardware, which surpassed the solutions proposed using passive computer vision at that time.

\section{Introduction}

The introduction is expected to give a short background information about the paper's topic.
It should also provide some context for the presented work as follows:
choose 1--2 papers from the related work section, that are very close to the paper you presented.
Explain in detail how your presented paper is different to those, and what is better about it.
Do not (!) repeat all related papers listed in the paper.

 

\section{Method description}
In this method, a dense reconstruction algorithm using depth maps is created to accurately reconstruct the 3D model in real-time. 
the algorithm pipeline is shown in Figure \ref{figure1}, 
including four parts, namely measurement, pose estimation, reconstruction update, and surface prediction.

\section*{Additional remarks about the report}

\begin{itemize}
	\item You are not expected to implement the methods described in the paper you have been assigned.
	\item Please use citations when appropriate. If you use any figures or tables, please make sure you cite the original paper. Add your citations in bibtex format into the file \texttt{egbib.bib}. An example is \cite{newcombe11ismar}.
	\item Please keep all your formulas numbered. You can use the equation environment for this:
	Please use the equation environment to get automatic equation numbering:
		\begin{equation}
		SE(3)$x_{k-1}$ = \left\{
		\begin{pmatrix}
		R & \mathbf{t} \\ \mathbf{0} & 1
		\end{pmatrix}
		:
		R^\top R = R R^\top = I_3, \mathbf{t}\in\mathbb{R}^3
		\right\}
		\end{equation}
	\item The report should be no longer than 4 pages (without citations).
	\item Please do not change the layout (page margins, font size, etc.).
